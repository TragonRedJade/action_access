## Please read before contributing

1. If you have questions about Action Access, use the
[Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/action_access),
[Gitter's chat](https://gitter.im/matiasgagliano/action_access) or
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/action_access).
**DO NOT** post questions here.

2. If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here.
Please send an e-mail to [mgag.issues@gmail.com](mailto:mgag.issues@gmail.com)
instead.

3. Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to
see if it was already reported or fixed. In case it wasn't, create your report
with a **clear description** of the issue and a **code sample** that
demonstrates it. Include Rails and Action Access versions, and as much relevant
information as possible. Tests or a sample application showing how the
expected behavior is not occurring will be much appreciated.

The more information you give, the easier it becomes to track the issue and fix
it. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself and others to replicate
the bug and figure out a fix.

Thanks for your time and support!
